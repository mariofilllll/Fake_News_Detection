# Fake News Detection Project

## Description
This project aims to classify news articles as true or fake using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By analyzing textual data, the project uncovers patterns and trains a model to distinguish between real and fake news.

## Included Files
- **Progetto 9.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the complete workflow for text preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Objectives
- Preprocess and clean textual data for analysis.  
- Vectorize text using TF-IDF for feature extraction.  
- Train a logistic regression model for binary classification.  
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.

## Features
- Data preprocessing: Tokenization, punctuation removal, and text cleaning.  
- Model training with logistic regression.  
- Visualizations: Word clouds for real and fake news.

## Tools
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, WordCloud, Matplotlib)  
- Jupyter Notebook
